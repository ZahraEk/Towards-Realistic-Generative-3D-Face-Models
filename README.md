# SymUV: Self-Supervised UV Texture Completion for Single-Image 3D Face Frontalization via Facial Symmetry
This repository presents a **research-oriented fork** of the official implementation of:

[**Towards Realistic Generative 3D Face Models (WACV 2024)**](https://github.com/aashishrai3799/Towards-Realistic-Generative-3D-Face-Models/?tab=readme-ov-file),  
Aashish Rai et al., Carnegie Mellon University & Meta Reality Labs.

The primary goal of this fork is to investigate a self-supervised UV texture completion framework for generative 3D face modeling under extreme pose variations, self-occlusion, and large missing-texture regions.

## Overview

Reconstructing complete and realistic facial UV textures from a **single in-the-wild image** remains a challenging problem due to extreme pose variations, self-occlusion, and the absence of ground-truth UV supervision.

While the original work introduces a StyleGAN2-based framework for high-quality joint synthesis of facial geometry and texture, it assumes access to well-structured training data and does not explicitly address **UV degradation under large pose changes**.

This repository introduces **UV Symmetry GAN**, an **end-to-end self-supervised framework** for **UV texture correction and completion** from a single image, **without requiring complete UV maps, multi-view data, or 3D scans**.

## Key Idea

The core idea is to exploit the **intrinsic bilateral symmetry of human faces** as a source of **implicit supervision**.

Instead of hallucinating missing regions blindly, the method:
- identifies a *healthy* facial half using reconstructed 3D geometry,
- transfers reliable texture information from the healthy side to the degraded side,
- and refines the UV map through adversarial and perceptual supervision.

## Quick Start (Google Colab)

The easiest way to try the UV Symmetry GAN pipeline is through the provided Google Colab notebook, which runs the full UV completion and 3D reconstruction process end-to-end.

[![UV Symmetry GAN pipeline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15e7944b-4493-4daa-8869-c7fb25182397)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ZahraEk/SymUV-3DFaceFrontalization/blob/main/SymUV-3DFaceFrontalization.ipynb)

The notebook walks through:

- installing dependencies,
- downloading pretrained models,
- running DECA-based reconstruction,
- performing symmetry-guided UV completion,
- rendering completed 3D meshes,
- generating multi-view visualizations and rotation videos.

No local setup is required beyond a Google account.

## Running Inference

Conda environment: Refer environment.yml
 
   ```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate new_torchenv
   ```
    
### Pre-trained Models

Download pre-trained models and put in the respective folders. 

Follow [[MICA](https://github.com/Zielon/MICA)] to download insightface and MICA pre-trained models. Put the weights in `insightface` and `data/mica_pretrained` folders, respectively.
Follow [[DECA](https://github.com/yfeng95/DECA)] to download DECA pre-trained weights. Put them in the 'data' folder.

Download AlbedoGAN modified weights from the following [[LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nJw8rUBTLcyhvCMTDohE_KcKKtFI6Orm?usp=sharing)]. Put these modified ArcFace backbone and DECA weights to generate better reconstruction results.

## Training code — UV Symmetry GAN 

We provide a self-supervised training pipeline for UV texture correction and completion from a single image, without requiring ground-truth UV textures or multi-view supervision.

During training, raw UV textures extracted by DECA are treated as incomplete and degraded observations. The network learns to correct these UV maps by exploiting facial symmetry priors, pose-aware masking, and dual-space adversarial supervision.

### Training Pipeline Overview

- **DECA Reconstruction**:
  
  Raw UV textures and 3D facial geometry are extracted from input images using DECA after face detection and alignment.

- **Pose Estimation & Healthy Side Selection**:
  
  Head pose is estimated from reconstructed mesh vertices to automatically identify the healthy (less occluded) facial half.

- **Symmetry-Guided UV Completion GAN**:
  
  The generator is conditioned on the concatenation of the raw UV texture, facial mask, and horizontally flipped UV map to predict corrected UV regions.
  A dual UV-space discriminator (global and seam-aware PatchGANs) enforces realistic texture synthesis.

- **Render-Space Supervision via DECA**:
  
  The completed UV texture is rendered back into image space through DECA, enabling image-space adversarial, perceptual (VGG), and identity-preserving (ArcFace) supervision.

- **Seam & Consistency Refinement**:
  
  Additional regularization terms enforce smooth transitions along the UV midline and symmetry consistency between facial halves, improving texture continuity and visual coherence.

The full training framework is illustrated in the following diagram:

<p align="center"> <img src="./figures/uv_completion_framework_final.drawio.png"  width="90%"/> </p>

This design enables stable self-supervised training under extreme pose variations and self-occlusion, while preserving facial identity and texture continuity.
Training scripts and configuration details are provided for research and reproducibility purposes.
